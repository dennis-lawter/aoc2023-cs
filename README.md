# Bytomancer's C# Advent of Code 2023
Mainly created this to play with C# and figuring out a reflection runtime.

## Input
Input files are read from the system.
- `/examples/01.txt` for an example input for day 1.
- `/input/01.txt` for a true input for day 1.

## Executing
```bash
dotnet run -e d01s1
```
executes day 1 solution 1 with the example input.
